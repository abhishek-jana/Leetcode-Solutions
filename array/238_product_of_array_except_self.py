'''
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Time complexity : O(N) where N represents the number of elements in the input array. We use one iteration to construct the array L, one to construct the array R and one last to construct the answer array using L and R.
Space complexity : O(N) used up by the two intermediate arrays that we constructed to keep track of product of elements to the left and right.

Time complexity : O(N) where N represents the number of elements in the input array. We use one iteration to construct the array L, one to update the array answeranswer.
Space complexity : O(1) since don't use any additional array for our computations. The problem statement mentions that using the answeranswer array doesn't add to the space complexity.
