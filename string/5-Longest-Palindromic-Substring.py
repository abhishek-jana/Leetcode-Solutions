"""

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

        Question:
            Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.
            You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

        Sample Input 01:
            s = "babad"
        Sample Output 01:
            longest_palindromic_substring = "bab" ("aba" is also considered)

        Sample Input 02:
            s = "cbbd"
        Sample Output 02:
            longest_palindromic_substring = "bb"

        Approaches:
            1) Brute Force - O(len(s)*len(s)*len(s))
                 # Calculate all the substrings using two for loops - i from 0 to len(s) and j from i to len(s)
                 # Check whether the substring from i to j is palindrome or not (s[i:j] == s[i:j][::-1])
                 # If true and length of the substring is greater than the previous palindromic substring,
                 # Update the result with the current substring
                 # Return the result after the execution of the for loops
            2) Expanding by the centre - O(len(s)*len(s))
                # Loop i from 0 to len(s)
                # Consider the longest palindromic substring is s[0] and set the max length to 1
                # Find if a palindromic substring exists with i as a centre.
                    # Case 1: For even length palindrome, the left and right values are set to i and i+1 with p as 0
                        # Expand until left and right are in boundaries and s[left]==s[right], left -= 1, right += 1
                        # Increase the length of the palindromic substring p by 2
                        # If the length of the palindromic substring is greater than max length
                        # Update the longest palindromic substring and max length accordingly (s[i-p//2+1:i+p//2+1])
                    # Case 2: For odd length palindrome, the left and right values are set to i-1, i+1 with p as 1
                        # Expand until left and right are in boundaries and s[left]==s[right], left -=1, right += 1
                        # Increase the length of the palindromic substring p by 2
                        # If the length of the palindromic substring is greater than max length
                        # Update the longest palindromic substring and max length accordingly (s[i-p//2:i+p//2+1])
                # Return the longest palindromic substring
